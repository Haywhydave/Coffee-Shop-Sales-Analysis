## KEY INSIGHTS
1.  A small group of loyal customers significantly contributes to overall sales, showing the importance of building strong retention and loyalty programs.
2.	Sales distribution among Arabica (26.67%), Robusta (24.73%), Liberica (24.05%), and Excelsa (24.56%) shows no single coffee type dominates, indicating a diverse range of customer tastes.
3.	Some countries account for higher sales volumes than others, suggesting expansion strategies can target underperforming regions to balance market reach.
4.	Customers with loyalty cards tend to spend more, suggesting that investing in loyalty rewards can boost repeat purchases and overall sales.
6.	Sales vary across months/years, showing patterns that can help plan promotions during peak and low-demand periods.
6.	The top 10 customers contribute a sizable portion of total sales. Personalized offers for them could further increase revenue.
